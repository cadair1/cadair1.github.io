        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of you reading this probably already know me. Or you at the very least have some conception of who I am. Now for those of you who don't know me at all, I suppose I could start with a little background. What I studied in school, what am I doing now and what I will be doing in the future. But I won't do that, mainly because I don't think that would interest anyone. There can only be one reason for anyone to come here, and that is to find out what motivates someone to write and to publish that writing online for the world (or more precisely the small group of individuals I can rope into reading this). The reason for my writing is simple: a fear of inertia. While inertia may be a physical principle, I think it applies equally well to individuals. Many of us find ourselves going down a path (career or otherwise) either because we have to (good intentions don't pay rent), or because our own conception of what it means to lead a successful life requires it. Eventually, after going on for some time, we look up to see where we are. Many of us, once we look up, find ourselves in a spot that we don't like. But we've already spent so much time going down our chosen path that to go back would seem too challenging. It would require us to admit a mistake, to admit that we wasted our precious finite time on Earth. Time that we will never be able to recover. So we lie to ourselves. We act in bad faith. Tell ourselves we had no choice. And so we keep going down the same path, thinking we'll eventually love all the things we hate.</p>
        <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is inertia. I'm sure that many of you find this to be rather dramatic terms to think in, but that's why they call me C. Melodrama Adair. It's this dramatic struggle that's been on my mind recently, whether or not the path that I've chosen is really the one that I want to or need to be on. That's not to say that I'm going to become an alcoholic, move to Paris and write a novel. More so I'm trying to look up and see where it is I am and where I want to be. Hopefully, this website will provide that for me.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since you are still here, I will leave you with one last thought. Towards the end of James Joyceâ€™s first novel <i> A Portrait of the Artist as Young Man</i>, the protagonist Stephen Dedalus finds himself discussing why he must leave Ireland. Stephen, explaining himself, makes the following remark, which has stuck with me ever since:</p>
        <p> <i> You made me confess the fears that I have. But I will tell you also what I do not fear. I do not fear to be alone or to be spurned for another or to leave whatever I have to leave. And I am not afraid to make a mistake, even a great mistake, a lifelong mistake, and perhaps as long as eternity too.</i></p>
