<hr>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The man I had been following kept screaming 'fuck you' every chance he got. Not when in public mind you. But every time he was alone he would scream obsenities at me. This time he was crossing the side street to his apartment.<br>
"Could you just leave me the fuck alone."<br>
I tried to explain to him that it was his time and that he needed to come with me.But he wouldn't listen to me.<br>
"I told you already. I'm not ready to die."<br>
With that he disapeared into his apartment building closing the door behind himself. As if it would make a difference. I passed through the large double doors of the apartment building into the grand but desolate foyer. The building was pre war. Which, one only god knew. Or perhaps Gabriel. Gabriel seemed to always know about these things. Total nerd. But a good guy.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The stairs were an old wooden oak that had been rotted through years of neglect. I creaked my way up the stairs to the man's apartment. I passed through the door into the man's apartment. He was standing at his kitchen island. A glass of scotch in his hand, he stared  blankly out his window. My appearence went unnoticed to him. He continued sipping his whisky right until I was right beside him. He glanced over at me. Startled he dropped his glass. It shattered on the floor. The amber fluid spread itself onto the white tiled floor.<br>
"How the fuck did you get in here!"<br>
"I came in through the front door. I'm sorry about the whisky. Can we go now?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No. We can't." He turned his back to me. He pulled paper towls off the rack and bent over to clean up the amber fluid. After he was done he pulled another glass off the shelf and poured another glass. He hunched himself over the kitchen island. Putting the glass to his lips he took a sip. And then he hung the glass near his mouth smelling the whisky. Staring out the window. But this time it was different. Before he had stared blankly out the window. Now he looked abjectly to the horizon. He was aware that I was studying him. He wanted me to know that he was a person who thought. That he mattered, that he wasnt some hopeless nobody. That he didn't just stare at infinity with a dumb look on his face. That even though he couldn't prevent his own demise, he would at least spend every moment preoccupied with the notion.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked over at me. Gestured his glass towards me. To ask if I would like some. I nodded. He turned. Pulled another glass down from the shelf. Placed onto the island and poured a small glass.<br>
"So, if you're death. Where's the scyth?"<br>
I picked up the glass. Suprsingly I had never drank whisky before. It smelt of the young men I had dealt with before. It's taste stung my throat on the way down. My face contorted drastically trying to contain the fumes that seemed to be trying to burst forth. He looked at me, mightily unimpressed. I hid my shame by responding to his question:<br>
"Management, thought it was best for our image if we got rid of the scyth."<br>
"Death has a boss?"<br>
"We all have someone that we report to."<br>
"Not me."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I figured this would happen. I had read his file. In his earlier days he had written a succesful novel titled &lt;i&gt;About the Souffle.&lt;/i&gt; It was some pretentious affair about a man named Michel who spends his Sunday trying to find a souffle for his dear mother. However, he finds that none of the bakers in his town seem to even know what a souffle is. Each of the bakers attempts to construct for him this supposedly new creation. Going so far as to generate mantis puddings, rat pies and cockroach cake. All of which they insist are the creation the customer desires. As the day progresses, the man is forced to further and further out of the town. Where the buildings are ever increasingly chipped and decayed. Eventually the man stumbles upon an almost destroyed building. But in the window he spots a souffle on a cooling rack. He approaches the window looking in. To his horror, he finds his wife sleeping with the baker. But a third figure is drawn in from the shadow. The would be customer watches in horror and pleasure as both his wife and usurper are slain by a wretched old man. Their throats cuts and immaculate skin drenched in crimson blood. After the dastardly deed, the old man takes the souffle off the cooling rack and exits through the front door. On his way out he bumps into Michel. Apologizing he continues on his way. In that moment of sober reflection Michel realizes what he must do. He places his hands around the neck of the old man, strangling him. The life drains out of the old man's face. Michel takes the souffle and leaves, as a crowd begins to form around the corpse of the old man. Arriving at his Mother's house, Michel finds that the door has rotted and no longer stands in its frame. Stepping into the house he finds the bones of his long deceased Mother. Staring out the window of his childhood home, he sees that all the houses on his street have fallen down or are in a state of disrepair. Catching his reflection in the mirror, Michel sees deep lines and wrinkles in his face. Realizing that he has spent his entire life looking for this souffle, Michel decides to take his own life. Smothering himself with the souffle.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was this ending that the author was most proud of. You see souffle is derived from the french for breath. So in sense the protagonist was being smothered by their own breath. It was this immense sense of irony, that the author most enjoyed. The book was obviously a huge success. It's focus on absurdity and satire made it a hit with a self-aware generation obssessed with using its own meaninglessness to elevate it's social status.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The success of the book made the author an even more unbearable ass. He spent most of his time, lecturing young hopeful fools on how to create artistic masterpieces. This, despite the fact that none of his preceding works amount to any success of the past. And now he was lecturing me.<br>
"You see, the only boss I could possibly have are my passions. They are the only things I follow with one hundred percent conviction."<br>
I sipped on my whisky, hoping that the silence might give him turn to quit from speaking. It did not.<br>
"You're going to have to explain, fully why you don't have a scyth though. I thought you needed it to cleave souls from the bodies of the dead?"<br>
"Well, yes that is certainly what they were for. Although management was worried about the missuse of scyths. Ya know. Cleaving the souls from people before it was their time to go. So now, soul cleaving is done on a voluntary basis."<br>
"And what if someone refuses to go with you?"<br>
"I don't know. This is a relatively new initiative, so no one has actually refused to die yet."<br>
"I'm the first. huh."<br>
"hmm. Yes, you would be the first."<br>
"So what will you do now?"<br>
"I guess, I'll have to call my boss. If you really insist on not coming with me."<br>
"I think you should do that."<br>
I took the cell phone out of my pocket and dialed John.<br>
"What the hell do you want at this hour? I'm trying to have dinner with my family."<br>
"I've got this fellow. Francis Mann. He doesn't want to go voluntarily."<br>
"Have you told him, that if he doesn't come with you that he'll have to spend a probationary period in purgatory?"<br>
"You'll have to spend time in purgatory, if you dont with me?"<br>
"Yea. I don't really care about that. I'm on the cusp of writing my most important work. I can't die now."<br>
"He says he doesn't care about that."<br>
"Well, you'll have to file an official scyth use request. If you file it by tonight, you might be able to get the request in by the end of the week."<br>
"Ok, thanks."<br>
"Have a good night." And with that he hung up. Leaving me to stare at the triumphant author. His lips curved in a crooked smile.<br>
"It didn't sound like it went so well."<br>
"Thank you for the whisky. But I have to go now."</p>
