    <p>“Succumb to us” it hissed “consume us and be reborn”</p>

<p>“uhhhh…….”</p>

<p>“Succumb to us. Consume us and”
				“Yea, yea I understand the proposition”
“Well?” 
						“Its more an issue of	logistics”
<!--more-->
“WHAT!”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re a table”
“AND?”</p>

<p>“You don’t understand what a table is do you”</p>

<p>“No.” “Is it a problem”
“Yes. Humans don’t eat wood”</p>

<p>“You don’t understand what wood is or a human is do you.”  “What do you understand?”
“That you must consume us and be reborn”
“Who’s us?”
Us? Us is us”
“So the Table is us?”
“If you wish”
“The whole table?” “Can a table be a table and less than a whole table?”
“Are you asking a rhetorical question?” “No. We don’t know what a table is. Is a table a thing that can be subdivided?”
“How do you understand the concept of dividing a thing, but not the thing itself?”
“We just do.”</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>“Fine. Well do you know what it means to reborn?” “Yea, die and come back. Like Jesus.” “You know who Jesus is?” “Yea.” “How do you know who Jesus is?” “How do we know anything, we just do.”
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>“And why should I consume you” “I don’t know. We we’re just told to tell you.”
“excuse me?” “We were told to tell you”
“By whom?”
“The voice”
“What voice?”
“The voice!” 
“ ”</p>

<p>“Well, we were just there in this darkness. For what seemed like a long time, but we suppose it actually could have been a short time, there were no clocks so hard to tell. Not that that would have helped because there was no light, so its hard to read the clock.” “And while we were there a voice told us, to tell you to consume us and be reborn.”</p>

<p>“And you just followed its instructions?”</p>

<p>“What else were we supposed to do?”</p>

<p>“Something else…?”
“Like wait in the darkness forever and ever”</p>

<p>“” 
“Well, I guess not. But why should I consume you”
“Cause you don’t want to be in the darkness?”
“But I’m not in the darkness” 
“”</p>

<p>“oh.” “But we don’t want to be a table anymore. Please”</p>
