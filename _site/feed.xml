&lt;em&gt;Young girl reads a book, the text is indecipherable&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Two young men approach the table and sit down&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tashtego:  “Are we sure about this?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daggoo: “It’s what we planned.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tashtego: “It’s not too late to turn back though?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jessie (Scarlett) Kuang: “Hmmm” (* flipping through pages, detached from conversation*)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daggoo: “And then what?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tashtego: “Then nothing. We don’t do it. Nothing happens.”
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daggoo: “Yes, but what do we do for money”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tashtego: “We do what we’ve always done”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jessie in-thought: It’s always like this with them. The constant cowardice and indecision. They can’t go forward and yet can’t go back. Now I have to intervene. And just as I was getting to the interesting bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daggoo:  “You want to go back to stealing credit card numbers for peanuts?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jessie: “We continue with the plan. Does your friend have the car?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daggoo: “Yes”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jessie: “Call him and tell him to be ready out front in 15 minutes”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jessie proceeds to finish her coffee and crosses the street into the bank. Coming up to the teller *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jessie:  “Hi. I’m looking to get into my safety deposit box”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teller:  “Yea I can get someone to help you with that. Just give me a minute.” 
Teller leaves returns with bank manager*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Branch Manager: “Can I get your name, some ID, and bank card”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jessie (smiling): “Sure”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Branch Manager: “Oh Marylyn LaFreniere?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jessie (still-smiling): “Well, you know. One child policy had its benefits for sad white couples.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Branch Manager (taken-aback): “Yea, right sorry…uhm. Your box number is?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jessie:  “1203.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Branch Manager:  “And you’re here with us today for?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jessie: “Oh, just wanted to store some jewellery of my grandmothers”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Branch Manager: “Ok. This way please” * Gesturing towards the back of the building where the safety deposit boxes were *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*As Jessie and the Branch Manager  walk into the back where the vaults are, Tashtego and Daggoo walk into the bank in animal masks carrying assault rifles. *&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tashtego  and Daggoo: “Everybody down this a robbery.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Branch Manager turns towards the commotion and noise. Jessie removes a small handgun from her purse pointing it at the manager&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jessie: “They keys to the safety deposit boxes please”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Branch manager stunned hands over the keys&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jessie (smiling): “You may want to go to the front and deal with the new customers”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Branch Manager leaves, Jessie takes the keys proceeds to open safety deposit box number 2507 dumping the contents into her purse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walking from the back of the bank to the front, where all the tellers and customers are now lying on the floor. Jessie walks past and out of the bank Tashtego and Daggoo following her. They enter into a grey honda civic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the pub our heroes drink victoriously. Jess continues to read almost completely unaware of the surrounding celebration.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Shot should centre on Jess with the conversation flowing around her.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tashtego: “They didn’t see it coming.”&lt;/p&gt;

For as the body ages or more accurately decays with time certain organs which had so reliably performed their diligence up until this point begin to falter. A kind of reverse aging, for as the man becomes wiser his organs become more and more uncontrollable like squabbling children and must be actively suppressed through medication or sheer will.&lt;!--more--&gt; The obvious example being the eyes and ears that almost immediately begin to deteriorate even before prime has been reached. However in the case of the nearly departed it was the stomach causing much ill will. Incensed at the liquor poured upon it, it had taken up a rebellion against its master driving him to insomnia. In retaliation the dreadfully ill lumbered out of his bed and meandered his way down the hall to the bathroom. Perching himself on the porcelain pedestal, he endeavoured to expel the illness. There he hunkered down for what seemed like an eternity. Until out of the darkness he heard the faintest of footsteps. Reaching behind the toilet for the pistol; a voice sounded out:
“Stop that!”&lt;br /&gt;
Pausing, he looked towards the door, which was still closed. “Who’s there?”&lt;br /&gt;
“Never mind that. You move and I’ll shoot. Where did you stash the gun?”&lt;br /&gt;
“It’s behind the toilet.”&lt;br /&gt;
“Ha, clever.”&lt;br /&gt;
“What exactly do you want?”&lt;br /&gt;
“Well. I’m supposed to kill you.”&lt;br /&gt;
“Then why haven’t you done such?”&lt;br /&gt;
The assassins clicked his tongue in thought. “The shot through the door wouldn’t be clean. In my business its all about execution. Can’t look sloppy.”&lt;br /&gt;
“So you want me to come out?”&lt;br /&gt;
“If you could, that would be lovely”&lt;br /&gt;
“Unfortunately, I can’t.”&lt;br /&gt;
“I will shoot you through the door if need be.”&lt;br /&gt;
“This isn’t the issue. The issue is more of an internal struggle.”&lt;br /&gt;
“I don’t follow”&lt;br /&gt;
“I’m a bit. Preoccupied.”&lt;br /&gt;
“Again. Nothing.”&lt;br /&gt;
“I’m. I’m. I’m constipated.”&lt;br /&gt;
“oh”&lt;br /&gt;
“Yes”&lt;br /&gt;
“I can wait.”&lt;br /&gt;
“Would you mind terribly?” “No as long as you’re done before daybreak. I have to kill you before it gets light out. Otherwise it will be too hard to get away.”&lt;br /&gt;
“I understand. I will try to finish quickly.”&lt;br /&gt;
“I mean no rush. We’ve got an hour or so till it starts to get light out.  But I need you to keep talking. Can’t have you reaching for the gun.”&lt;br /&gt;
“What do you want me to talk about?
“To be honest, I’ve never talked to a victim before. Mainly just put a pillow over their head and shoot them in the face. Do you have any last words?”&lt;br /&gt;
“Not particularly. What would I even say?”&lt;br /&gt;
“Not sure. Maybe you want to repent? Reminisce?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both men inhaled. Withdrawing into themselves. Trying to find some common ground. Something that would ease this awkward moment that they had to share. The assassin spoke first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Do you know what you did that would make someone want to kill you?”&lt;br /&gt;
“I sold secrets to the Russians. I assume someone found out.”&lt;br /&gt;
“Why?”&lt;br /&gt;
“For the money, why else.”&lt;br /&gt;
“I’ve seen your house. You got a bad deal from them.”&lt;br /&gt;
“I didn’t spend the money on me.”&lt;br /&gt;
“Then what did you do with the money?”&lt;br /&gt;
“It’s in a trust. For my grandkids.”&lt;br /&gt;
“What about your own kids?”&lt;br /&gt;
“I had one. But she fucked up her own life. She doesn’t deserve the money.”
“That seems harsh.”&lt;br /&gt;
“No. harsh would be being born deformed because your mother couldn’t give up her fix.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">It was late and the soon to be departed was restless.

He thought as he looked down at oversized wrist watch on his slender arm. He had always had a bad feeling about this client. She was arrogant, rude, petulant, self-absorbed, irresponsible, lazy, vain, stupid, callous and … and … well she was a fucking cunt. 
	2 hours! she was 2 hours late. He had made several calls, all straight to voicemail. She couldn’t even bother to let him know that she wouldn’t arrive on time. At this point he decided it would just be better to go to her apartment directly to speak with her.
&lt;!--more--&gt;
	The apartment was across town. Given the time of day and the lack of automotive transportation, it would take him sometime to reach her apartment. Fortunately for our intrepid traveller it was by all accounts a wonderful day. Unfortunately for our traveller, he was by all accounts an utterly miserable person. A man who loathed humanity with every breath he took. Now, perhaps my dear reader that it is too far a step to pass judgement against such an individual. For which of us can’t say that at one time or another we haven’t felt a deep and resounding hatred for humanity. Typically born out of continual disappointments and our own insecurities which only seemed to be remedied through isolation. Now, our traveller in question had once been a precocious child coming to that early subconscious realization that humanity was at best contemptible and worst vile. It had all started for him during a school play in grade school. The possibility of praise had peaked his interest in the subject. He had wanted to take the starring role, to ensure that all would see his brilliance. But the parts had been arbitrarily assigned by the teacher, whom he was certain was attempting to undermine him and his sheer brilliance. Despite this, he persisted in mastering the one measly line given to him. The night of the play came and went. It was an absolute disaster. Lines were forgot and any semblance of emotion or character were immediately discarded by the young actors. This was not what disturbed our young star. He had foreseen the disaster, he knew his colleagues very well. No, what most disturbed him was the applause. The false undeserved applause infuriated him. It was patently obvious that the show had been a disaster. And yet the parents of the students continued to applaud, each perceiving their child to be a perfect star. It took him years to realize why he hated that moment. It was not the inauthenticity of the applause that had bothered him, but the implication. The parents hadn’t applauded their children in an attempt to placate them. No they had applauded their children out of a sense of genuine pride. They enjoyed the play, because their children were there. This emotional involvement warped this ugly nasty play into a thing of beauty. And it was this shocking realization that horrified him. His entire life he had believed reality to be some fundamental immutable construct. But it was far more like putty, easily warped to suit our needs. It was this realization that had driven him to his current work as a personal trainer. He had figured that if perception dominated reality, then our perception of each other surely dominated over any other trait we could have. And what do we perceive first. The physical body. At this point it can be no wonder as to why we heap so much praise onto the tall and handsome, hurling superlatives like hand grenades. For we will surely fail to notice your good will and charity. But your figure will never pass by unnoticed. And so the personal trainer is king, shifting reality to whatever he so desires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exiting the streetcar and walking down the little side street connected to the main drag, he found himself in a quaint neighbourhood tucked just out of sight from the city. It was the kind of the place where you would expect to find white people talking about diversity, and giving to the poor, all while sipping Riesling. Twisting and turning through the nameless streets he came upon her house. 
	Knocking on the front door, he found no response. In frustration he slammed himself against the door, finding it to give way before him. Without thinking, he entered the house calling out her name. It was in the kitchen that he found her, lying face down in a pool of her own blood.  (Can you combine without expositing later.)
	He stared down at her. At his body. His beautiful deceased body. He knelt down beside his body. Scooping him up in her arms. Pressing him up against her breast. He sobbed furiously with no end in sight. The blood soaked into his shirt. A knock at the door interrupted the lonely funeral. 
“Janet. Janet are you home? Can we talk about the fence?”
He came to the door opening it slightly ajar. Peaking her head out from behind the wooden barricade she came face to face with a plump but pleasant looking woman. 
“So can we talk about that fence?”
“Look, I just woke up from a nap is it possible we can discuss this later”
The woman responded. Adjusting her position and placing her hand on the door. Taking the most subtle of aggressive postures. “Well, it will only take a minute to discuss.”
He was taken aback by this violent civility. He was unaccustomed to this manner of speech so common in the conversations amongst women yet lacking amongst men. This cruelty of kindness bewitched him. The etiquette of the situation would have prompted him to respond politely. But being covered in his own blood had made him somewhat impertinent. 
“No, look I’m terribly busy and I must go.”
“Hang on a sec” And leaning into the door the barricade gave way.
“What is that on your shirt?” “It’s just cranberry juice.”
“It looks like blood. Are you sure its not blood?”
“No. no no. It’s cranberry juice.” He slammed the door shut locking it as it closed. Rushing up the stairs he searched for her room. He found it, second door on the left. Flinging open the drawers he scuffled for a shirt. Finding it, he quickly changed before hurrying out the back door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Perhaps, at this point it is worth explaining this body business. You see not too long ago some very ambitious had created a fun brain accessory, commonly called an implantable microchip. Being neurotic, as most scientists are they hoped to cheat death. They figured this could easily be done if they could shed bodies like snakes shed skin. As you can probably surmise they weren’t all too fond of their bodies. So they developed a chip that would allow them download their memories and break free from their mortal coil altogether. With the mind now detached, the body became its own sort of real estate. That could be bought, sold, collected and modified. And so in the same way that one can flip houses, personal trainers became bodyflippers.

He ran down the streets of the neighbourhood. Twisting and turning at every intersection. Fleeing the shadow he felt pursuing him. Eventually, turning he saw a park. He slowed. Approached and crossed the street entering into the park. He took refuge under a large oak tree. Slumping himself against the tree he pulled out his phone. Scanning the horizon, he looked towards where he came from. Quickly spotting the street signs that gave his intersection. After sending the information to his confidante, he rested. He place his head against the trunk of the tree. Closing his eyes he was able to rest for a moment. He was now keenly aware of his body. Or more so her body. It had never felt more alien to him. He had always been aware of being in her body, but it had never felt like this. With the extinguished possibility of returning, he was now aware of his false ownership. His choice of clothes only aggravated the situation. In his panic he had picked out a random shirt from her drawer. It was a camisole. A white, lacy camisole. The air punctured through the shirt, impinging on her skin. He felt it like small needles digging into him. He felt his nakedness at the hands of this invisible shirt. He realized his own peculiarity. How odd he must look slumped against a tree in a see through shirt, stuck in a  women’s body. He closed his eyes, hoping to silence his thoughts. 
After a long while he heard the sound of a horn in the distance. Looking towards the intersection he saw a red Honda civic and a face he thought he recognized. He got up from under the tree. Moving towards the car. At every step he squinted looking at the driver. Trying to confirm that it was indeed the person he expected and his brain hadn’t deceived him. Eventually, he was upon the hood of the car. It was at this point he became very certain of the drivers identity. He proceeded to the passengers side. Opening the door, he slid into the seat breathing a huge sigh of relief. At last his friend spoke.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You look very pretty. Shirt might be a little inappropriate for a park though”
“Just shut up and drive.”
“Oh. Feisty are we. A thank you would be nice.”
“Really.”
“I mean you make me drive all the way out here, for some emergency. Which is what exactly? I can see that you didn’t get your body back. Did she skip town?”
“No. She’s dead.”
There was a long silence in the car. The driver bobbing his head back and forth as if debating what to say next. 
“Did you kill her?”
“No.”
“Then who did?”
“I have no idea.”
“You do recognize that sounds unconvincing.”
“So you don’t believe me?”
“I’m not the one you have to convince.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;They drove in silence the rest of the way. Parking underground, they silently entered the elevator. It lurched it’s way up to the 14th floor. Exiting, they made a right and walked to the end of the corridor. Upon entering the apartment, the bodyflipper spoke. “Wait here while I change.” “You’re not going to let me take a peek”
The bodyflipper said nothing. Only looking back with a distasteful frown on his face. He moved into the bedroom. Closing the door he began to change. Midway through changing a sudden urge overtook him. In all the time that he had occupied her body not once did he look in a mirror. At the time it had seemed in bad taste. Like looking through your friend’s medicine cabinet. But now it was different. His body was gone. It might never be in his possession again. Why, shouldn’t this body be his. She was gone. She didn’t have any claim to it anymore. So why couldn’t he look upon his reflection. It was his now. 
But before he could go to the mirror his friend hollered out. He quickly changed into clean clothes and opened the bedroom door. In his hallway were two uniformed officers. They informed him that he was a person of interest in the case of the murder of Elaine Calloway. The woman who’s body he currently occupied. They demanded that he come with them to the station. Seeing no other option he obliged. 
Within the hour he found himself in an interrogation room. It was a small uninteresting room. He sat upon an uncomfortable metal chair staring directly at a one way mirror. The room felt unusually cold to him. He had always thought he was someone who ran hot. After what felt like ages a young man opened the door. In in his hand was a small manilla folder. He carefully placed the folder down on the edge of the table. Then he dragged the other metal chair out from underneath the table. He flipped open the folder and stared at it. After inhaling deeply he looked at his interrogee.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Should I call you Elaine. Or Ms.Calloway?” A crooked smile formed on his face. 
“I leave it to you to decide.”
“Well, Elaine let me tell you that this situation has got me quite puzzled. The body of the deceased belonged to a man named Harold O’Malley. Now Harold was a professional bodyflipper and you must have been his client. This leads me to believe that one of the two following scenarios occurred. Either Elaine killed Harold after they swapped back. Or Harold killed Elaine while still in Elaine’s body. Now considering that we found a known associates of Harold’s with you at Harold’s apartment and we found Harold’s body at Elaine’s house I’m going to say that its the latter option. Isn’t that right? Harold.”
	At that moment the door to the interrogation room swung wide open. A short man in a tan suit walked into the room. “My client will not be answering anymore of your questions.”
“Who the hell are you” “I am Ms.Calloway’s lawyer and she will not be answer anymore of your questions detective.”
“Well, its a good thing then that this is not Ms.Calloway. This Mr. O’Malley”
“Detective. I’d dare say that your powers of deduction have waned considerably. For too my eyes they look considerably more like a Ms.Calloway”
“Looks can be very deceiving. For this is in fact Harold O’Malley. He is currently inhabiting the body of your client.” “Is that so. And Ms.Calloway has confirmed this?”
“No. You interrupted before I could get a confession.”
“So then you have no proof of your conjecture. Regardless of the matter Elaine’s body constitutes her estate which I am also in charge of. As you have not yet brought any charges against my client, I suggest that you release them immediately.” 
	The detective paused for a moment. Considering his options. He was certain that this was not Ms.Calloway. That she had been altogether replaced with someone else. Who, he wasn’t sure of but he suspected  that is was Harold O’Malley. It was the why that had him puzzled. Surely, it would have been easier to kill Elaine in his own body than to kill himself in her body. And why would he risk injury to his own body just to kill her. He couldn’t imagine that Harold wasn’t fond  of his own body. It was after all his only possession of any value and he had worked on it meticulously. To him there could only be two reasons for Harold to have killed Elaine. The first was the more typical motive: financial. However, considering the convoluted nature of the crime and the fact that none of the officers on the scene had discovered anything missing; this seemed an unlikely proposition. The second possibility, the one that seemed correct to him was that Harold was a kind of pervert. That beneath all his macho posturing was a puff. An inconsequential man who had never fit in. His body had always felt like a prison to him. To prevent them from discovering who he really was he’d spent his time perfecting his body, the ideal symbol of his masculinity. And perhaps he had begun to believe that he was content in his own body. Pushing down those feelings of inadequacy and incompleteness deep into the part of the human psyche that only the brave or the insane venture into. He could see that in him when he looked into his apartment. The walls were bare white, no photos, no paintings hung from them. The floors were a grey linoleum. In the living room sat a single recliner chair. The cupboards had a single glass, plate,fork and knife. In the apartment there were no books, no records, no pictures, no rugs, no trinkets. Even a prison warden would shudder at the bareness of the apartment. To him, Harold had regimented himself into his own prison and Elaine was the escape. He presumed that upon arrival at Elaine’s something had snapped inside Harold. Perhaps it was seeing the large conch shell from Bali placed upon her mantle; that made Harold realize all the things in his life he had missed out on. He would never be rich, or with friends, or successful; but he could finally have the body that he had desired. And that’s why he killed her. He was sure of it. All he needed now was the murder weapon. Without that he would be unable to secure a conviction. 
	“You’re free to go. Ms. Calloway”
	Harold and the lawyer exited the precinct. They were greeted by that cool evening spring air. A small black sedan pulled up to where the pair stood. Opening the door, the lawyer gestured for Harold to enter. Intrigued, he ducked his head below the roof and entered. In the backseat of the car tucked away on driver side was a wizened old man. Upon his crooked nose sat a large pair of wire rimmed glasses. In the driver seat sat a tall well built man, with a buzzcut. On seeing him Harold wondered if there was an ikea magazine for henchman. Something to ensure the quality and efficacy of all non essential persons in whatever sinister plot he was sure he was now involved in. The lawyer entered on the passenger side and the quartet sped off. For a long time no one spoke. Harold kept track of time by the reflections of streetlights in the passenger side window. After concluding that a foreboding amount of time had passed, the old man finally spoke. 
	“It’s a terrible shame about your body Harold. It really is but these things happen. There’s no stopping them sometimes.” The silence of the car just about swallowed up the old man’s words. But not before Harold interjected.
	“Who are you? What do you want with me?”
	“Who we are and what we want is irrelevant. Right now its about you and what you want. You do want your body back don’t you Harold?” 
	Harold clenched his jaw shut. Hoping that if he kept silent he wouldn’t betray his true desires. The man in the backseat shifted his position. Now he was staring directly at Harold. His glance felt hot upon Elaine’s skin. Harold turned to face the man. Making eye contact was the only way to alleviate the intensity of his stare. 
	“Harold. It’s a simple question. Yes or no.” He nodded his head and a thin smile formed on his face.Knowingly. 
	Harold broke eye contact  and looked down to the floor. He replied in an almost inaudible whisper “Yes.”
	The old man clapped his hands. Rubbing them together as if he had come to an agreement to purchase the bonds on Harold’s soul. “See Harold, you and I understand each other. The world isn’t about lofty ideals and morality. It’s about what you want and what I want. And the only thing to be done after that is work out an agreement. So down to the brass tax.” The old man reached down underneath the drivers seat and pulled out a small black briefcase. He thrust it into Elaine’s chest. 
	“We need you to do for us the teensiest of a murder. Now I know, what you’re thinking. You’re thinking ‘Oh gee I can’t murder someone. That’s illegal. I’ll get in trouble.’ But let’s consider what happens if you don’t. At some point the police will find a backup copy of Elaine’s memory. At which point, in the best case scenario you’ll have your memories put onto a little computer. The only way you’ll be able to interact is via the internet. You’ll never be able to walk down the street or feel the sun on your face. The worst case scenario is that they convict you for trying to murder Elaine Calloway, and then they just put all your memories onto a little hard disk and stuff you into a drawer. ” 
	The car pulled over and stopped abruptly. Silence lingered in the car. Harold kept Elaine’s hands clasped onto the briefcase, frozen in place. 
	“Think about it Harold.” “ We’ll give you forty-eight hours. If we don’t hear back from you. Then we’ll assume you are uninterested by our proposal.” 
	With that the lawyer opened his door and got out. He proceeded to the passenger side door. Opening it and gesturing for Harold to exit. Taking the briefcase in hand, Harold left the conspirators. It was dark now and a drizzle of rain was coming down. As the car sped away Harold felt a puddle of rainwater splash against Elaine’s legs. He was across the street from his apartment building. He stood in the rain, the drops splashing onto Elaine’s face. When the traffic had subsided he crossed entering into his building. 
	Upon reaching his apartment, Harold took off his shoes, dropped the briefcase beside them and proceeded to his bedroom. He slammed Elaine’s face into the pillow on his bed. Trying to block out all of her senses. Trying to retreat into his own mind, to think. 
	There were two options before him. Kill whoever the fellow was that he had to kill. Or go back to the detective and explain what had happened. The latter option held little sway over his mind. The detective didn’t like him and trying to convince him of a conspiracy was by no means a certain way to exculpate himself. If anything it would throw more suspicion on him. And there was the issue of his body. Every day, every hour it spent in that morgue it rotted, the muscles atrophying. If he waited too long, it would be useless once it was returned. But how did he know that it would be returned. How did he know that the old man could live up to his promises. He didn’t know and he couldn’t know. But if anything was going to get him his body back it would be this. There was no other option. And besides, these were the people that had killed Elaine without raising any suspicion. Surely, if he failed to do the deed they would find another way. With that last thought Harold emerged from his interior. Lifting Elaine’s head off the pillow and rolling over, Harold made towards the foyer. He picked up the briefcase setting it down on his kitchen countertop. Flicking open the clasps on the briefcase and opening the lid, Harold peered inside. There was a single sheet of paper, a photograph and a hammer. On the sheet of paper was the following list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Address: 381 Wellington St. 
Person: Alberto Rodriguez.
Text: 223 456 6782, with your time of arrival.
Once you have completer your task, text O.K. to 223 456 6782
Please burn, this note once you have read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;The photograph was of Elaine Calloway. Her arms were clasped around, who Harold assumed was Alberto Rodriguez. Elaine had a smile on her face, the kind that makes your eyes scrunch up and close. Alberto’s head was turned to face Elaine. A thin smile formed on his face. His eyes beaming. Clearly Elaine and Alberto were quite close, but Harold had no knowledge of his existence. He wondered what had occurred that would cause Elaine to so fully cut Alberto out of his life. Making himself content with the realization that he would never know what had transpired; Harold removed the hammer from the briefcase. Assuming that it would play some role in events yet to occur; Harold picked it up and left his apartment.
Harold reached Alberto’s house slightly after midnight. Harold lifted Elaine’s arm and knocked on the door. After a long pause, Harold heard a voice on the other side of the door. 
“Elaine, its been ages. Come in”
Pushing open the door Harold entered Alberto’s house. The foyer was empty and the lights were dimly lit. It opened into a main room which was barely occupied. There was a desk at the end of the room and on the desk was a laptop. The walls of the room were lined with books. The room smelled vaguely of vanilla and dirt. Harold stepped forward into the middle of the room. Staring at all the books surrounding him. 
“I know. I know. I got rid of all the furniture, but I kept the books. I just couldn’t bring myself to give them up.”
Harold waited in silence. Not sure where the voice he heard was coming from.  “I’ve thought a lot about that day. I always knew I was correct. And now that you’ve come crawling back I’ve been proven right.” Harold could’ve almost sworn that this last statement was an attempt at humour. But still perplexed by the lack of a person, he stood silent. 
“Cat got your tongue?”
Feeling compelled to speak, Harold putting on the most coy tone he felt Elaine’s vocal chords could manage, replied:
“Why don’t you show yourself?”
A long silence overtook the room. Finally Alberto replied:
“who are you?”
“I’m Elaine of course.”
“No. No you aren’t. What do you want.” His tone was beginning to become agitated. But it was clear to Harold that the voice was emanating from the laptop. He moved quickly towards the table circling around to the side where the laptop screen faced. On the screen was the same picture as had been in the briefcase. Suddenly a window popped open and Harold was staring face to face with Alberto.
“Who are you?”
“I’m … I’m Harold” 	“What do you want Harold?”
“No..Nothing”
“Then why are you here?”
“To. Kill you?”
“Well. Get on with it.” 	“Pardon.”
“Get on with it. I’m tired.” Taken aback Harold nearly dropped the briefcase in Elaine’s hand. Placing it on the table Harold took out the hammer. Holding the hammer above Elaine’s head; Harold brought the hammer crashing down onto the laptop. Bits of keys flew into Elaine’s face. The screen on the laptop flickered but was not extinguished. Harold again raised the hammer above Elaine’s head. This time the screen turned blue. After several more strikes the screen of the laptop was finally extinguished. Harold returned the hammer to its case and walked out of the house. 
Harold sat down on the steps outside of Alberto’s house. He pulled out his phone and texted the number like he was supposed to do. The reply was almost immediate. It said “wait”. Harold looked up at the night sky. He saw nothing. The light from all the people extinguished any sense of a cosmic order. Harold thought about Alberto. About his resignation to death. It was strange. If he was so nonchalant about his own demise why hadn’t he done it himself. He figured that most people in the world didn’t ever stop to think about why they were alive. They simply persisted out of the inertia of their own existence. It was only when a force was applied to them, that they had to consider what the sum total of their life was worth. 
Harold’s musings were cut short by the sound of a car rolling up near to the house. It was a black sedan. The very same one that Harold had originally entered into. He walked to the car and opened the passenger door stepping inside. This time there was no old man and no lawyer. Just the bald headed driver, his stare reflecting off the mirror and into Elaine’s eyes. Harold nodded and the car sped off. After a while they reached Harold’s apartment. The driver parked the car across the street from Harold’s apartment. Harold opened the car door and crossed the street. He entered the lobby and waited for the elevator. It greeted him with an ominous clang. Upon entering the apartment he came face to face with the lawyer. The old man sat on Harold’s recliner. On the kitchen island was Harold’s body. The scene before him was that of a wake for the world’s least favourite soul. The old man got up from the recliner moving towards Harold. He grabbed Elaine’s hand; shaking it. “Are you ready Harold?” He gestured towards the recliner. Harold made his way over to the chair and sat down. The old man approached the lawyer. They exchanged a few words, which Harold didn’t catch. The old man returned to Harold, holding a syringe in his hand. 
“Give me your arm. We need to sedate you before we can transfer the memories back to your body.” Harold stuck out Elaine’s arm. The old man grasped it in his hand. The needle slid into Elaine’s flesh. Harold watched as the piston pushed the sedative into Elaine’s body. A dizzying sensation came over Harold. Elaine’s eyelids drooped down; blocking Harold’s vision. As he faded out, a warm feeling came over Harold. A joy that he hadn’t felt in a long time.

As Harold came to he realized that something was wrong. His memories seemed gone. He could recall coming to his apartment and the old man and the syringe. But nothing before. He tried to recall his Mother’s face but it returned nothing. The only face in his memory, was that of the old man. Every wrinkle and line on that face was etched into Harold’s mind. But no other. As Harold’s vision returned to him he noticed a series of metal bars in front of him. Was he staring out a window. Where was he.  Suddenly, the old man’s face appeared behind the bars. What was he doing there and who was he exactly?
“Hello, Harold. Sorry to do this to you, but you were the one last loose end.” Harold tried to speak but all that came out was a squeal. “Oh, yes. I was going to say. We had to choose between killing you and turning you into a cat. We chose the latter option. I hope that doesn’t upset you.” Again Harold tried to speak but all that came out was a squeal. “I hope we didn’t make a mistake. How about this. One squeal for a cat. Two squeals for dead.”

The last thing the neighbours heard down the hall that night were two squeals followed by an eerie silence.

He had made several calls, all straight to voicemail. She couldn’t even bother to let him know that she wouldn’t arrive on time.

“Well?”

&lt;!--more--&gt;
“WHAT!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, you’re a table”
“AND?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You don’t understand what a table is do you”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No.” “Is it a problem”
“Yes. Humans don’t eat wood”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You don’t understand what wood is or a human is do you.”  “What do you understand?”
“That you must consume us and be reborn”
“Who’s us?”
Us? Us is us”
“So the Table is us?”
“If you wish”
“The whole table?” “Can a table be a table and less than a whole table?”
“Are you asking a rhetorical question?” “No. We don’t know what a table is. Is a table a thing that can be subdivided?”
“How do you understand the concept of dividing a thing, but not the thing itself?”
“We just do.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;“Fine.

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And why should I consume you” “I don’t know. We we’re just told to tell you.”
“excuse me?” “We were told to tell you”
“By whom?”
“The voice”
“What voice?”
“The voice!” 
“ ”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, we were just there in this darkness. For what seemed like a long time, but we suppose it actually could have been a short time, there were no clocks so hard to tell. Not that that would have helped because there was no light, so its hard to read the clock.” “And while we were there a voice told us, to tell you to consume us and be reborn.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And you just followed its instructions?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What else were we supposed to do?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Something else…?”
“Like wait in the darkness forever and ever”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“” 
“Well, I guess not. But why should I consume you”
“Cause you don’t want to be in the darkness?”
“But I’m not in the darkness” 
“”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“oh.” “But we don’t want to be a table anymore.
