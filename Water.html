<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Water is a calming force. Staring out at the waves. It never fails me." She didn't look at me as she said this. Her eyes scanned over the horizon. The sky was overcast. I feared it would rain soon. She was standing on the pier with me. The white water frothed below us. We had walked a long way to be here. Down in the valley, tucked underneath the city. Along the busy road, that petered out in a residential neighbourhood. And finally through side streets until we hit the water.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had come here years and years ago. The sky was overcast that day. It was on this pier, that I had first kissed her. But now my body betrayed me. I was frozen looking at her. The wind whipped up her hair. It drove into my skin like tiny needles. She spoke without facing me.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is where it began. If we hadn't come here. None of this would have happened. She never would have been born. She never would have suffered." Her words knocked the air from my lungs. I wanted to respond. To refute her accusations. But I couldn't, because I had wondered the same thing.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We had spent so long putting together every aspect of our life, that we had expected parenting to be easy. We faltered at the first step. But after long doctors visist and nervous anticipation it finally happened. I remember holding her for the first time. She looked just like her mother. I remember, when I held her I saw her whole future in an instant. I saw her going off to kindergarten. I saw her holding hands with the first boy she would love. I saw her leaving us to go to school. I saw her graduating. I saw her with her first house. I saw her changing the world. I saw her with her own children. All that time compressed down to a single moment.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In those first few years, my vision certainly seemed like prophecy. She was the sweetest child. She spent all her time in our backyard, playing with earthworms and beetles. She loved every creature and they loved her. She would fall asleep, nestled on our old black lab. He wouldn't move a muscle, lest disturb the sleeping angel. I can't remember a time, that she wasn't smiling.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time changed that. As she aged, she withdrew into herself. Her smile faded. Every time I tried to speak to her she seemed irate. I had always assumed that she was closer to her mother. That teenage girls didn't want to talk to their fathers. But considering all that happened, perhaps I had assumed too much.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought coming here would clear my head. That coming back to the start would make it all make sense. But it doesn't. I thought that the sound and sight of the waves crashing against the shore would bring me calm. But I just want to push them back into the ocean, so that they'll never come back. And never crash again onto our shore."</p>
