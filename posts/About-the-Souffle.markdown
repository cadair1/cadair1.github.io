Patio coffee shop *
*Young girl reads a book, the text is indecipherable*
*Two young men approach the table and sit down*

Tashtego:  “Are we sure about this?”

Daggoo: “It’s what we planned.”

Tashtego: “It’s not too late to turn back though?”

Jessie (Scarlett) Kuang: “Hmmm” (* flipping through pages, detached from conversation*)

Daggoo: “And then what?”

Tashtego: “Then nothing. We don’t do it. Nothing happens.”

Daggoo: “Yes, but what do we do for money”

Tashtego: “We do what we’ve always done”

 Jessie in-thought: It’s always like this with them. The constant cowardice and indecision. They can’t go forward and yet can’t go back. Now I have to intervene. And just as I was getting to the interesting bit.

Daggoo:  “You want to go back to stealing credit card numbers for peanuts?”

Jessie: “We continue with the plan. Does your friend have the car?”

Daggoo: “Yes”

Jessie: “Call him and tell him to be ready out front in 15 minutes”

Jessie proceeds to finish her coffee and crosses the street into the bank. Coming up to the teller *

Jessie:  “Hi. I’m looking to get into my safety deposit box”

Teller:  “Yea I can get someone to help you with that. Just give me a minute.” 
Teller leaves returns with bank manager*

Branch Manager: “Can I get your name, some ID, and bank card”

Jessie (smiling): “Sure”

Branch Manager: “Oh Marylyn LaFreniere?”

Jessie (still-smiling): “Well, you know. One child policy had its benefits for sad white couples.”

Branch Manager (taken-aback): “Yea, right sorry…uhm. Your box number is?”

Jessie:  “1203.”

Branch Manager:  “And you’re here with us today for?”

Jessie: “Oh, just wanted to store some jewellery of my grandmothers”

Branch Manager: “Ok. This way please” * Gesturing towards the back of the building where the safety deposit boxes were *

*As Jessie and the Branch Manager  walk into the back where the vaults are, Tashtego and Daggoo walk into the bank in animal masks carrying assault rifles. *

Tashtego  and Daggoo: “Everybody down this a robbery.”

*Branch Manager turns towards the commotion and noise. Jessie removes a small handgun from her purse pointing it at the manager*

Jessie: “They keys to the safety deposit boxes please”

*Branch manager stunned hands over the keys*

Jessie (smiling): “You may want to go to the front and deal with the new customers”

*Branch Manager leaves, Jessie takes the keys proceeds to open safety deposit box number 2507 dumping the contents into her purse*

*Walking from the back of the bank to the front, where all the tellers and customers are now lying on the floor. Jessie walks past and out of the bank Tashtego and Daggoo following her. They enter into a grey honda civic*

*In the pub our heroes drink victoriously. Jess continues to read almost completely unaware of the surrounding celebration.* *Shot should centre on Jess with the conversation flowing around her.*

Tashtego: “They didn’t see it coming.”

Daggoo: “I swear the old man nearly shit himself.”
